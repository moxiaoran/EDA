Just finish Mathematics for Machine Learning series from imperial College London Coursera website. Understand the mathematics behind the details of some most used machine learning algorithms such as PCA. I just come across Julia Sailge video on how she use PCA in real life data science analysis project. I hope by reproduce her project, I'm also able to apply this techniques in my own analysis project. 

```{r}

# load packages and dataset

library(tidytext)
library(scales)
